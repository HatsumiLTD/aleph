**Aleph** is a 3D object viewer and annotation/measurement tool built with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io), [AMI](https://github.com/FNNDSC/ami), [StencilJS](http://stenciljs.com), and [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com).

## Website

[Visit the Aleph demo page](https://aleph-viewer.com) to try it out.

## Scope
- Usable as a web component within any page/framework and has a [Universal Viewer](http://universalviewer.io) integration
- Has a supporting Control Panel (a separate web component) showing associated settings for a given mesh or volume
- Straight-forward to debug, using a single source of truth and unidirectional data flow ([redux](https://redux.js.org/))
- Themable to allow customised colour schemes (css variables)
- Encapsulates 3D rendering logic in a well-defined component model, with pre-existing community support/adoption (A-Frame)
- Utilises the component model to extensibly display 3D media file types (GLTF+DRACO, DICOM)
- Renders 3D scenes declaratively, decoupling the presentation layer from the application layer
- Permits annotation of points on a 3D mesh or volume with a title and description
- Permits measurement of lengths and angles, with the potential to be extended to areas and volumes
- Permits annotation/measurement data to be stored/retrieved as json
- Permits slice and volume views of volumetric data, with axis/slice selection and point cloud windowing controls
- Permits panning, rotating, and animated transitions between annotations/measurements
- Has "in-scene" annotation/measurement tools as opposed to overlaid, permitting future AR/VR/XR use cases

Aleph can be used to display GLTF files and DICOM series. GLTF can be used in conjunction with DRACO compression.

To annotate/measure an object, open the "Settings" tab in the control panel and check "Enable Node Placement". Clicking on a 3D object will create a node which can be given a title and description. Nodes can be used as points of interest or can be connected via edges. With a node selected, SHIFT + Click to create an edge between that and another node. Edges can be used for measurement and can also be labeled with a title and description. Units of measurement can be changed in the control panel. SHIFT + Click between edges to measure angles.

The two top-level web components are `<al-control-panel>` and `<al-viewer>`. `<al-control-panel>` wraps a tabs-based interface containing `<al-url-picker>`, `<al-settings>`, `<al-graph-editor>`, and `<al-console>`. `<al-viewer>` contains the A-Frame scene and all 3D rendering logic. It also contains a Redux store that acts as single source of truth for the viewer and control panel. `<al-viewer>` can be used independently of `<al-control-panel>`, which can be lazy loaded to provide additional options.
